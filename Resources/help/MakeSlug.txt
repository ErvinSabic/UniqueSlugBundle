The <info>%command.name%</info> command creates a slug property with annotations inside your entity or regenerates slugs for all records in the entity database table.

<info>php %command.full_name% BlogPost title</info>

If one of the arguments is missing, the command will ask for the entity class name and the property- or method name interactively.

You can also (re)generate all the records in the entity database table:

<info>php %command.full_name% BlogPost --regenerate</info>
